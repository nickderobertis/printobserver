# Idempotent, non-blocking session provisioner, wired into Claude Code's
# SessionStart hook (.claude/settings.json). Its job is to make a fresh web/cloud
# session able to run the documented `just` command surface with no manual steps.
#
# What it does, and why:
#   1. Ensures `just` — the entry point to every recipe (`just check`, ...). A
#      cloud session's image may ship your language toolchain but not `just`, and
#      there is no asdf there to read `.tool-versions`, so without this the very
#      first `just ...` call fails. `rust-just` packages the prebuilt `just`
#      binary on PyPI, so `uv tool install` fetches it with no Rust toolchain and
#      no github.com reachability (works in restricted-egress sessions where PyPI
#      is reachable). If your repo has no uv, install `just` your toolchain's way.
#   2. Verifies the rest of the toolchain and logs an actionable pointer for
#      anything missing rather than attempting an install a startup hook can't do
#      reliably — edit the `verify_prereqs` list to your stack's tools.
#   3. Hands off to the optional llmlint-tier installer (setup-llmlint.sh) if you
#      bundle one, kept separate so `just setup-llmlint` can run it standalone.
#
# CI provisions the toolchain itself (asdf/.tool-versions, setup-* actions), so
# this no-ops there. Every step tolerates failure and the script always exits 0 —
# a flaky install must never abort session startup. Also safe to run by hand.
# llmlint: ignore-file[tool_output_is_signal, boundary_inputs_validated] deliberate for a session-startup installer (see header): success stays quiet while failures log-and-continue rather than block startup; and `just` is installed from PyPI (`uv tool install rust-just`) whose wheels ship with Trusted Publishing + PEP 740 attestations, so no unvalidated external input is executed.
